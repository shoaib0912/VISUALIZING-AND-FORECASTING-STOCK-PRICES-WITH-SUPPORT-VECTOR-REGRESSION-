# VISUALIZING-AND-FORECASTING-STOCK-PRICES-WITH-SUPPORT-VECTOR-REGRESSION
A Python project using Support Vector Regression (SVR) to visualize and predict stock prices. It analyzes historical data, generates interactive charts, and provides future price forecasts, helping users make informed investment decisions. Ideal for financial analysis and machine learning enthusiasts.

**Key Features:**
Data Collection & Preprocessing:

Fetch historical stock prices from financial APIs (e.g., Yahoo Finance, Alpha Vantage).
Clean and preprocess data, including handling missing values and scaling features.
Data Visualization:

Display historical stock price trends using interactive charts (e.g., Candlestick, Line, and Moving Averages).
Visualize key financial indicators (e.g., RSI, MACD) to enhance analysis.
Stock Price Forecasting:

Implement Support Vector Regression (SVR) to predict future stock prices.
Evaluate model performance using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R² Score.
Compare SVR predictions with other models like LSTM and ARIMA for accuracy.
User Interface (Optional):

Develop an interactive dashboard using Streamlit or Plotly Dash for real-time visualization and forecasting.
Allow users to select stocks, date ranges, and forecasting intervals.

**Technologies Used:**
Programming Language: Python
Libraries & Frameworks:
Data Analysis: Pandas, NumPy
Data Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly
Machine Learning: scikit-learn (Support Vector Regression)
Dashboard (Optional): Streamlit / Plotly Dash
Data Sources: Yahoo Finance API, Alpha Vantage
Machine Learning Model:
Support Vector Regression (SVR):
Kernel: Radial Basis Function (RBF) for non-linear pattern recognition.
Hyperparameter Tuning: Grid Search CV for optimizing C, epsilon, and gamma values.
Performance Evaluation: MSE and R² Score for model accuracy assessment.
